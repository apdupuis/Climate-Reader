I saw a lot of machines fight
but I saw only in the infinite
	rear

The earth of black coal 
is the only humid spot
in this cleft of rock.

1945

*A desolate wind from the city
On the bottom of the sky
In the ravines
The thunder means business

1956

*These old houses
crumble, the unemployed 
stumble by us straining,
harassed.  The air is cold

1965

*planes grounded
	around the world
		no flight paths

1978

*The vastness of death and its insignificance, debris
			flying in a scorched haze of dragonflies-
We aren't going anywhere.
Every rainstorm now dislodges
a rock or two,
weakening what's left
of the foundation.

1985

*know this wind as
		fire.  Flame
at the heart of stone.
The bottom of the well.  The last interior:  touch.

1990

*pangs at rising
	at dust a life comes to a close
					

torsion 
		the star blinks
				a town in tatters
					screams

2000
